                <i>Fleshing Out The Image</i> is a collaborative artistic project that explores the biopolitics of
                image-making and the sensorial and political materiality of visual and sonic technologies. The project
                brings into
                dialogue phenomenological reflections on embodiment and moving image culture with conceptualizations of
                enfleshment as a mode of power and capture but also of possibilities for sensual and political refusal.
                <br><br>
                The project thus inquires into the visual-sonic experience as both embodied and embodying, as
                grounded in the multisensoriality of the embodied encounter with cinematic technologies, and as
                constitutive of bodies, subjects and ethical orientations.
                <br><br>
                The programme consists of an artistic and curatorial residency in Porto; the exhibition project
                <i>CHAMBER</i>, on view at the Carlos Alberto Chapel in Porto; and a lecture series entitled <i>FLESHING
                    OUT THE IMAGE: Pleasure and Refusal in Contemporary Aesthetics</i> which will be made available on
                this website
                throughout November and December 2020. Speakers in the series include Tina Campt, Alexander Ghedi
                Weheliye, Amber Jamilla Musser, Tavia Nyong’o, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson and Denise Ferreira da Silva. To see the full project visit fleshingouttheimage.com.

                <i>Handle with Care: Tales of the Invisible</i> takes look at architectural and speculative exercises
                from the past that constitute helps us understand the current context
                that requires a humanist reflection on different forms of care. Developed in three chapters, the
                exhibition brings together a diversity of content ranging from studies,
                axonometrics, photographs, illustrations and sketches. A set of interviews and personal testimonials of
                some of the represented authors, their family members, researchers, and representatives of institutions,
                also allows us to contextualize these approaches and practices carried out across different European
                territories.

                Notions of time and space are altered. A disease spanned the globe, and its consequences are
                unprecedented. We are witnesses to a Global Pandemic crisis. Putting on hold the debate on borders as a
                physical and geographic limit and its implying crises of identity and conflict, countries turned to
                fences and walls as a means to mitigate an inescapable quandary common to all worldwide. It is no
                novelty that millennials and Gen Z are characterised by distancing and alienation, but the new order
                imposed by the pandemic has imposed a revival of the "bedroom generation" in the post-digital era.
                Everything is reduced to the display screen and the simulated reality within it.
                <br><br>
                A digital magazine entitled <i>Rife</i>—initially created within the discipline of Editorial Design in
                the MA
                of Communication Design at the Fine-Arts Faculty of Lisbon—emerged as a response to the pandemic
                condition and its global effects on the individual, social, political, ambiental and cultural levels,
                raising questions surrounding what we know as our reality at this day in age. These questions are made
                and answered by designers, now being opened to a greater spectrum of creatives. This is pertinent as we
                creatives operate within our contexts, and in order to render ethical alternatives to realities
                presented, we must investigate and understand them. At the moment we were quarantined, we were
                physically inhibited to circulate freely, so we turned to question how to circulate content
                digitally—not by option but by necessity—, thus revealing a doorway to cultural production in the
                digital world and simultaneously embracing the democratic distribution of the open source medium that is
                the internet.

                Hiatus is a collective made of five designers based in Portugal moved by the contingency of
                contexts. We felt the urge to know how the scenario of the global pandemic could help us define
                ourselves as designers by questioning what it is to partake in cultural production in a framework where
                remote connections were imperative and conventional sources of inspiration had been hindered. We also
                wanted to investigate the phenomenon itself, through its rationalization in an attempt to define what
                kind of society we live in—not only currently but also looking forward from this experience.
                <br><br>
                Hence, our approach is founded on the perception that the effects of this historic period we are living
                are not primarily a burden, but a terrain in which new ways of thinking and producing may come to light.
                Using design and our knowledge to stimulate discussion as we believe our responsibility is, we aim to
                raise questions about realities, cultural decisions, ethical and political actions, exploring new

                The name of the collective came about as a reflexion on the condition we were forced into. As graphic
                designers, and most importantly as creatives, are few of the least affected in our daily production by
                working remotely due to the digitalization of our tools. However, as the pandemic unfolds, regular daily
                operations were put on hold, indefinitely. And so did we. HIATUS in its definition—a break in continuity
                in a sequence or activity—represents the temporal space in which we came together as a collective in an
                attempt to counter the silence of being put dormant, thus rendering the collective as a productive force
                in idle times and the coming period of adaptation into the unknown.

                Founded in 2016, Apparatus Architects is an award-winning, international architecture and design office
                with offices in Brasilia and Lisbon. The office provides services in the fields of Architecture, Urban
                Planning, Graphic, Interior and Object Design. Apparatus Architects’ practice has been honored with the
                prestigious Architizer A+Awards in 2020, naming Apparatus Architects as one of the most innovative
                industry leaders and strongest emerging talents.<br><br>
                Designed to put images first – whether static or moving –, the website showcases the work of the
                multidisciplinary architecture office which spans though different scales, from object design to
                urbanism. In showcasing the projects, the importance was to create a container for technical drawings,
                imagery and references that resembles architectural presentation boards, making the website appealing for both
                potential clients and architects.

                In <i>The Manifesto for the Truth</i> (2013), Edward Snowden calls for transparency regarding data
                processing
                in the context of mass surveillance. Accusing governments of obscuring the truth regarding personal data
                usage and hindering the debate of the theme, the whistle-blower urges the availability of knowledge and
                the protection of human rights.<br><br>
                <i>Unexpectedly Absent: The Halt of Remote Intimacy</i> addresses the issue of data rights as a
                fundamental
                human right through the creation of a fictitious company, <i>VERAX</i>. The organisation presents itself
                as a
                beneficent entity, advertising counter-surveillance products and obfuscation strategies—from browser
                plug-ins to
                fashion—reclaiming users’ data rights. <i>VERAX</i> grants digital opacity and the re-inscription of
                such
                rights to its clients and through its extensive catalogue of obfuscation tactics comprising a variety of
                formats,
                which are marketed in the company’s website.<br><br>
                As a project, <i>Unexpectedly Absent</i> combines a commercial element, the promotion of a lifestyle and
                commerce around products to render your digital presence opaque, with the democratic act of
                disseminating
                knowledge around counter-surveillance, creating a layer of strangeness. This incompatibility presented
                in the
                project aims to promote the debate around data rights and present a criticism to its commercialisation.

                <i>Omniscience</i> is a project that stemmed from a research on mass surveillance.
                The main artefact of this project, an edited book, compiled a series of texts and projects on the
                research subject of mass surveillance that address concepts such as immaterial property, human rights
                and the societal contemporary state of Narcissus-narcosis—whether directly or indirectly—, alarming the
                reader of the opacity of such networks in which surveillance is nested. The website, on the other hand,
                functions as an expansion on the theme in question. Unlike the manner in which questions are posed in
                the research texts, represented on the left-side, the queries here are presented through an endless loop
                of fragments of news articles and projects that seem to blur the boundaries between cautionary tales and
                reality. We can’t help but wonder, to what extent will mass surveillance and the collection of data will
                continue to wrench the concept of property and human rights in a world where information is the ultimate
                <i>pharmakon</i>.

            <div id="about4" class="moreinfo">
                <i>It Takes Several Minutes For The Eyes To Adjust To The Dark</i> is a direct quote of Ingmar Bergman's
                daughter, Linn Ullmann, for a 2018 The New Yorker article, where Ullmann described the routine she and
                her father performed everyday before watching a film: they would enter a dark room and wait for their
                eyes to adapt to the dark. This time of adjustment—one's sinkage from light to darkness—is analagous to
                an adaptation from reality to fiction. The borders defined by those two ideas and the grey areas between
                them are prime examples of the spaces where design can act. The quote was the starting point for FBAUL’s
                2019 Communication Design graduation exhibition, which showcased the projects of 50+ students, along
                with a cultural programme where we debated how various disciplines (from art to urbanism, from geography
                to cinema) navigate between the real and the fictional.
                <br><br>
                In the post-digital era, reality and fiction have been diluted. The expression of this lack of
                definition isn't limited to just creative and artistic endeavours, but is often weaponized by various
                power structures, whether formal or informal. This instrumentalization deconstructs core values such as
                democracy, individual and collective identity, ethnicity, and other fundamental principles of our
                society.
                <br><br>
                Before this current and 'desirable' identity crisis, design always worked with and for reality. Its
                objects belong, circulate, and (re)construct reality. The frailty of the majority of communication
                design objects also contributes to this idea of a practice that 'serves' the present. In short, the
                inevitable shock with reality defines the social status of design. If 'design and reality' is a (false)
                truism, "design and fiction" might appear to be an improbable hypothesis. In the face of historical,
                legitimized practices—such as literature or cinema—design now reclaims its place in fiction.
                <br><br>
                At the end of another cycle of study in communication design at the Lisbon Faculty of Fine-Arts, we have
                gone over the dilemmas, the contradictions and the themes that pertain to contemporaneity. Through the
                projects produced this year, the students have either commented, critiqued or essayed reality, or turned
                it into fiction. We've steered very close to cinema, literature, mythology, but also to the hard truths
                of a reality that insists on presenting itself, suprising us, and deconstructing itself before our eyes.

                The corrosive fear of uncertainty has been pinpointed to be one of the sources of chaos in the real
                world. As a form of mitigating the chaos, <i>As Foretold</i> addresses an alternate reality that
                generates
                prophecies for every of its inhabitants, in attempt to decrease the atmosphere of stress and anxiety of
                the population, and based on the idea that certainty—here appearing in the form of such
                prophecies—will install, at last, peace of mind. This way, destiny is as certain as space, time and
                gravity.
                <br><br>
                Suddenly, all activity and reactions in this simulation boils down to the very concept of certainty. Why
                is it that people are so bound by the comfort of it? Do they believe they can alter the outcome? If you
                hold a «fatalist» prophecy, ambivalence or impending doom may be evident, but who is it to say that an
                «optimist» prophecy would not make the clocks turn? After all, chaos, the fear of chaos actually invites
                more chaos. And so on and so forth… So is it worth craving love and gold, if everything goes as
                foretold?

                PREFACE<br>
                On the year of 1977, NASA launched the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft into space. The
                mission objective of the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) in its ongoing journey is to
                extend the NASA exploration of the solar system beyond the neighbourhood of the outer
                planets to the outer limits of the Sun's sphere of influence, and possibly beyond. In
                August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space, the region between
                stars, filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago.
                Voyager 2 entered interstellar space on November 5, 2018 and scientists hope to learn
                more about this region. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their
                surroundings through the Deep Space Network, or DSN.
                <br><br>
                Aboard of the Voyager 1 and 2, NASA placed a kind of time capsule intended to
                communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials. Selected for NASA by a committee
                chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University, et. al. Dr. Sagan and his associates to portray
                the diversity of life and culture on Earth, the contents of the phonograph record—a 12-
                inch gold-plated copper disk—include 115 images and a variety of natural sounds,
                musical selections from different cultures and eras, and spoken greetings from Earth people in 55
                languages, and printed messages from President Carter and U.N. Secretary
                General Waldheim. The 115 images encoded in analog form in the Golden Record depict
                scientific knowledge, human anatomy, human endeavours and the terrestrial environment
                —all these aspects are vital pieces of information in building a vision of what humanity
                entails and where it inhabits. Ultimately, it contextualises society and its environment and
                is thus a direct reflection of both, it is a snapshot of our world as we know it (or knew until
                the 1970s).
                <br><br>
                Now what if we were to portray and communicate contemporary society through
                imagery? First one would have to possibly come to a conclusion on what is contemporary
                society characterised by, what is its character. In the context of hyper-information,
                increasing human interconnection yet a feeling loneliness, of ambivalence
                and uncertainty—all topics raised by Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman in his legacy of
                readings on liquid modernity—, the post-modern times are characterised by the generation of millennials.
                Such individuals, born between the 1980s and 2000, were the first generation to be born alongside global
                internet, and thus witnessed the birth of memes.
                <br><br>
                As noted by Metaheven in <i>Can Jokes Bring Down Governments</i> (2014), the notion of the “meme” was
                introduced by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in the late 1970s
                as a way to describe what he called a “cultural gene.” Memes are units of culture and
                behaviour, which survive and spread via imitation and adaptation. Part of their appeal is
                that memes spread spontaneously. Paul Mason, the BBC’s travelling chronicler of all
                things crisis-related, found that “with the internet [...] and above all with the advent of
                social media, it’s become possible to observe the development of memes at an
                accelerated pace […]." The three qualities that define the success of memes are
                longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Longevity indicates how long a meme can last.
                Fecundity applies to the appeal of a meme, whether it is catchy. Copying-fidelity is about
                the strength of a meme to withstand mutation in the process of copying and imitation. It
                determines how much of the original core remains intact when the meme is in
                transmission.
                <br><br>
                According to Richard Dawkins, a meme is a ruthlessly pervasive idea that applies to
                phenomena we see all around us (Metahaven, 2014), it is unavoidably a reflection of its
                own time and culture. Thus, it seems likely that portraying contemporary society through
                the lens of the millennial phenomena, the meme, might be the most effective way of
                obtaining a snapshot of this generation.
                <br><br>
                For being strictly digital content, of easy accessibility and spread, it has much to say
                about the society in which it spreads and replicates from the brash uncensored language,
                dark humour to the topics they may cover. In the aforementioned book, Metahaven
                argued that memes play a distinct role in protest, equating them to “political posters” to
                the resistance of the past, but that is the tip of the iceberg. The fact that memes draw
                references from pop culture and subcultures, it is a perfect system to display what are the
                greatest sources of media in current days—whether they are tv series, internet forums or
                short homemade video clips. Departing from such references, memes may stand as
                protest to the political atmosphere, as well as serve as form of mass comfort for shared
                beliefs and feelings, or purely entertain for the sake of the medium, unavoidably showing
                what we value today as a generation. In hindsight, much of the images herein
                demonstrate a great sense of irreverence towards many themes, which offers an even
                greater insight into what is to be a millennial.
                <br><br>
                In that sense, this book is built as a concept album, that is, an album in which its pictures
                hold an even larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually; where a
                selection of memes are catalogued and classified, then showcased in a selection of
                adapted replicas taken from the internet.

                In the current context of negligence, a sense of loss of control and alienation of the world in regards
                to both domestic and foreign affairs that affect society on a global scale, <i>Sensible</i> organically emerges
                to address feelings in a world that is losing touch. Its intent is to promote sensible conversation at
                an individual level (ideally translating into the greater scale of society) about current global
                socio-political issues that generate much anxiety for us members of the human race. The bi-annual
                publication asserts its sensible character by deconstructing each issue’s theme with relevant academic
                and cultural content (book excerpts, interviews, imagery). That serves the purpose of connecting the
                readers of <i>Sensible</i> worldwide through our common perceptions and concerns around the themes of each
                edition.
                <br><br>
                The theme of its first issue arises from the shared sentiment of anxiety towards the implications of
                post-truth. Granted greater momentum during the American elections in 2016 and again during the
                Brazilian elections of 2018, the concept of post-truth has infiltrated politics and the way society
                manifests itself in unprecedented ways. Moving the focus away from the manipulation of technology as a
                political tool and the depth and breadth of fake-news, our stance is that this is now common knowledge
                and we must dig deeper—what are the social and psychological implications of the new post-truth era.
                Thus, we intend to promote conversation, question and stimulate the emotional intellect of our
                readers—only then can society comprehend the changes its going through and in turn mitigate the arising
                problems in a sensible manner.
                <br><br>
                P.S. there shall be no advertisement or journalistic gibberish within the safe space of <i>Sensible</i>.
